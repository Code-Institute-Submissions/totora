Info on testing and deploying project:
Deploying was made using GitHub Pages. Once set up, deploying is automatic.

Testing has been done on MacBook Pro (15", end of 2013), Google Chrome. 
I have also used Inspect Element on Chrome to check responsiveness in iPad and iPhone.

Also I have used the following validation services:
<li>https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</li>
<li>https://validator.w3.org/</li>

Functionality you want to add:
This is meant to be a really simple project.

Bugs founds

A default size needs to be established so that all follow the same sizes and works well in different devices.
Solution: need to develop images editing skills.
